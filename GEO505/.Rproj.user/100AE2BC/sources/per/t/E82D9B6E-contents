## Question 1: Dataset (34 points)

Generate the **SAME** dataset that you saw in the lab instruction (i.e., 1,000 samples with an average of 300 and a standard deviation of 50), and print the first few observations using the `head()` function. 

```{r Q1}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(723)
# generate samples with rnorm function and
# store the samples in a variable called: sampled_data
sampled_data <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 300, sd = 50) |> round(digits = 2)
# look the first 6 sampled data
head(sampled_data)
```

## Question 2: Descriptive statistics (33 points) 

Print the `mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation` of the generated dataset in Question 1. 

```{r Q2}
mean(sampled_data)
median(sampled_data)
min(sampled_data)
max(sampled_data)
var(sampled_data)
sd(sampled_data)
```

## Question 3: Data visualization (33 points)

### Q3a: What type of data do you have?

```{r Q3a}
# Our data is 'Quantitative continuous'.
```

### Q3b: Display a histogram for your data

```{r Q3b}
# draw histgram
hist(sampled_data, 
     main = "Histogram of Sampled Data", 
     xlab = "Values", 
     ylab = "Frequency", 
     col = "gray", 
     border = "black")
```

### Q3c: Display a boxplot for your data

```{r Q3c}
#draw boxplot
boxplot(sampled_data, 
        main = "Boxplot of Sampled Data", 
        ylab = "Values", 
        col = "gray")
```
